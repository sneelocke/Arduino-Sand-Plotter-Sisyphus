I had always wanted a Sisyphus sand plotter on my coffee table.  They were expensive and complicated to build.  I was trapped in Florida for six weeks watching over my elderly mother with only sand as a resource in a condo where air conditioning wasn't an option.  This was what I could come up with for cheap entertainment.  It also solved the AC problem.  We had to turn on the AC to keep the sand dry so it wouldn't clump!


The motor comes from a microwave oven on the side of the road. The 20 VAC adaptor from my junk wall wart drawer. The pin gears were used as they were cheap to make.  Some care is required to get their spacing correct.  I had a compatible drive gear to glue on the motor.  The turntable spins on a nail hammered into the base.  The toothpick is swept back and forth with a simple RC servo hot glued onto the base.  Sand comes from the nearby beach.  Due to the slow motor each revolution takes about 3 minutes.  This was perfect as it could be turned on and provide hours of entertainment for mom and visitors who were perpetually mesmerized by it.

I used an Arduino Uno clone but anything that can drive a servo will work, use an Uno or compatible if you wish to use this code.

Someday I will make a real Sisyphus sand plotter which moves a ball mystically about on a table filled with sand.  For now this is pretty good!

Enjoy.  -Andy
